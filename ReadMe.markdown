##Intro

DFeedback (DaisyDisk Feedback) is a component for providing in-app feedback and requesting support. Along with the text, the component can send the user's e-mail and optional system configuration profile.

Here's how it looks:

##Usage

DFeedback is a package of source code (Cocoa, Obj-C) that you simply add to your project.

The API is simple: 

- First, call +[DFWindowController initializeWithFeedbackURL:] once to initialize the component and provide a URL for sending the feedback.
- Call one of +[DFWindowController show*] methods to display the feedback dialog.
- If you want to do some fine-tuning, there is DFStyleSheet.m file containing some appearance/behavior constants.

Don't forget to link to the following frameworks:

- QuatzCore
- AddressBook

##Origin, credits and legal stuff

DFeedback was inspired by [JRFeedbackProvider](https://github.com/rentzsch/jrfeedbackprovider), but totally rewritten from scratch (except maybe some tiny portions of code).

The component is available under the terms of non-restrictive [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

##FAQ

__What license does it use?__<br />
We selected [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). It's simple, it's fair and it's free of all the [GPL's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL) bullshit.

__Why not just use JRFeedbackProvider?__<br />
We used [JRFeedbackProvider](https://github.com/rentzsch/jrfeedbackprovider) in the very first versions of [DaisyDisk](http://www.daisydiskapp.com), but later replaced it with a custom component. While both look similar on screenshots, DFeedback has the following advantages:

* polished look and feel
* visual feedback for missing e-mail address when "reply to" is checked
* optional system info (collected in the background, can be previewed by users)

__Are there any downsides?__<br />
We haven't build DFeedback as an all-purpose ultra-flexible component. It's designed with DaisyDisk in mind, but you're free to modify it to fit your special needs.
